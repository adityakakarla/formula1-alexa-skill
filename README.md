# Formula 1 Alexa Skill
Hello!

This is the code for an Alexa skill that returns the days, hours, minutes, and seconds remaining until the next Formula 1 Grand Prix. The skill uses the Ergast F1 API to pull F1 scheduling data.

This was my first attempt developing an Alexa skill. I learned the ins-and-outs of Alexa skill development, including slots, utterances, intents, and more.

In addition, I strengthened my Python skills and incorporated API calls.
